# Bug Fixes Applied - January 28, 2026 (Part 2)

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Navbar Mobile Menu Overflow
**Problem:** Massive yellow/black stripes overflow in mobile menu.
**Cause:**
- Content was duplicated (nested inside itself due to bad edit).
- No scrolling support for long menus on small screens.
**Fix:**
- Removed duplicated code in `navbar.dart`.
- Wrapped menu content in `SingleChildScrollView`.
- Added `ConstrainedBox` with `maxHeight` to prevent it from taking over the whole screen unexpectedly.
- **File:** `lib/core/widgets/navbar.dart`

### 2. Category Name Cutoff
**Problem:** Category names (text) below icons were cut off or not appearing fully on small screens.
**Cause:**
- `GridView` aspect ratio (222/160 = 1.38) was too short for the content height (icon + 2 lines of text + padding) on mobile.
**Fix:**
- Updated `childAspectRatio` in `DashboardScreen` to be responsive.
- Uses `0.95` (much taller) for screens < 640px.
- Keeps `1.38` for larger screens.
- **File:** `lib/features/home/dashboard_screen.dart` (Line 765)

### 3. Package Card Layout Overflow
**Problem:** "Add to Cart" and "View" buttons overflowed the bottom of package cards.
**Cause:**
- `GridView` aspect ratio (0.75) was too short for the content stack (Header + Title + Buttons) on narrow mobile screens.
**Fix:**
- Updated `childAspectRatio` in `DashboardScreen` packages section.
- Uses `0.55` (very tall) for screens < 640px.
- Keeps `0.75` for larger screens.
- **File:** `lib/features/home/dashboard_screen.dart` (Line 998)
